## DOE App Manifesto

1. DOE tools and options should be widely available to researchers
2. Current software requires licensing and thus witholds valuable designs from the public
3. Previous authors have created DOE generators in Python
4. These existing DOE generators require knowledge of Python, and all of the struggle to get it configured
5. There is a lot of value in a tool that allows point and click interface with:
    - Factor and value input
    - Preview of design & download
    - Statistics about design merit (pending)
    - Compare design tools (pending)
    - <b>out of scope for now</b>: 
        - Linear & Nonlinear Model Selection & Fit
        - Suggestions about path forward?

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. `python gui_doe.py`
